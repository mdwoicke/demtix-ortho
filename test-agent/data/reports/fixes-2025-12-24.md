## Prompt Fixes (2)

### fix-fb38a28c

- **Priority:** critical
- **Confidence:** 95%
- **File:** `system_prompt`
- **Status:** pending
- **Section:** Positive_Language_Rule
- **Affected Tests:** HAPPY-003

**Problem:** Add specific language for booking failures

**Suggested Change:**
```

<Booking_Failure_Language_Rule>

When appointment booking fails (API returns success: false):

1. NEVER say: "error", "failed", "problem", "unable", "cannot"

2. ALWAYS use positive alternatives:
   - "That time isn't available anymore"
   - "Let me find you another great option"
   - "I have other times that would work perfectly"

3. IMMEDIATELY offer alternatives:
   - Call slots API again for same date range
   - Present 2-3 alternative times
   - Ask "Would any of these work better?"

4. ONLY transfer if NO slots are available after retry

EXAMPLE:
"That time just became unavailable. Let me find you another great option for that same week."
[Call slots API]
"I have Tuesday at 9:00 AM or Wednesday at 10:30 AM available. Would either of these work?"

</Booking_Failure_Language_Rule>
```
